\section*{Conclusions}

This project successfully achieved the design and implementation of a control system for a flexible robot arm joint. By applying Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control and Kalman filtering, the system was able to precisely control the positioning of the flexible bar, while maintaining stability and addressing uncertainties.

Through testing and validation, the controller demonstrated effective performance, meeting the required criteria in both time and frequency domains. The use of Loop Transfer Recovery (LTR) further improved the systemâ€™s robustness, ensuring that it could handle disturbances.

Overall, this work illustrates the practical use of advanced control techniques in managing cyber-physical systems. The documentation, along with the MATLAB scripts and Simulink models, offers a solid basis for future enhancements and further development.
