Pre-filtering can play a vital role in shaping the reference signal before it enters the feedback loop by adjusting the input signal to compensate any new dynamics introduced by the controller or the plant. 

In this project, different kinds of pre-filters were used to achieve a more accurate positioning of the tip of the robot arm joint. One of them was an integrator, which was used to eliminate the steady-state error and push the system toward the desired output. Another example of the usage of pre-filters in our project are the gain adjustments introduced, which convert the signal's amplitude before entering specific parts of the system. By fine-tuning and using these pre-filters in our system, it is possible to reach the desired positions more quickly and accurately without having a big influence of noise/delays, therefore resulting in better overall performance.
